#### original intention to build a website of blogs

I find that I always forget what I have done during my former work when I need something I used to use. It really frustrates me that I have to refind and relearn materials.

Therfore, I decide to record what I have learnt so that I will be able to review and regain it conveniently.

I will record important things mainly and reduce the elaboration of personal feelings.
